## Javascript Lab

## Lab 1: http
### Branch - lab1
In this lab, I explored low level APIs XHR (XmlHttpRequest) and fetch API to make asynchronous http request.
Why it may be better to use libraries like Angular's HttpClient or axion?

In this lab, I worked on basic promises
Write some example about Promise Chaining, Promisification of async code, 
error handling in case of Promises.

## Javascript Lab

## Lab 1: http
### Branch - lab1
In this lab, I explore low level APIs XHR (XmlHttpRequest) and fetch API to make asynchronous http request.
Why it may be better to use libraries like Angular's HttpClient or axion?


## Lab2: Promises
#### Branch - lab2
In this lab, I will work on promises, and how to 
interact with it using then, catch, finally.
Write some example about Promise Chaining.
